# Duerer Tapestry TWBT

**In the summer of 2023, I was struck with a Strange Mood.**

This is a tribute to the past, a rare photo of a unique animal that
was the last of its kind. Back when there wasn't augmented reality
or artificial intelligence, a group of dwarfs banded together to
bring life to stone.

What you get:
* Beautiful Maps
* Beautiful Tiles
* Readable Text
